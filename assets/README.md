# Work Day Scheduler

Requirements for me to create Calendar app conserning with Javascript funtionality. Primarly, Calendar applications render well on a variety of events and allows user to save events for each hour of the day. As a developer, I will likely be asked to create Work Day Scheduler app to generate to events user-related events or have to develop an existing files by pictures how these look like.

## Directions Given

Firstly, I will use the HTML, CSS and mostly focus on JavaScript to establish Calendar app.
Setting up Webpages such as (index.html, style.css, and app.js).

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
